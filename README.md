Decision Trees, Feature Importance, Visualisierung

- Comparative Tree Analysis: Shows how model performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall) change with tree depth.

- Feature Relevance: Both bar plots and heatmap visualize which features matter most at different depths.

- Model Complexity Comparison: Tree plots make it easy to see how shallow vs. deep trees split on different features.

- Insight:

  Robust features maintain high importance across all depths
  
  Other features are highly relevant in shallow trees but become less important in deeper trees
